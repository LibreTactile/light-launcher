# üì≤ iOS Build GitHub Action for Godot

This GitHub Action builds an **iOS Xcode project** from a Godot 4.4 project. It can be run **manually** and works with or without code signing.

## üöÄ Usage

This workflow is triggered manually via the GitHub UI:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

---

## ‚úÖ Unsigned Builds (No Setup Needed)

By default, this workflow:

* Runs without secrets or certificates
* Generates an `.xcodeproj` and builds an `.ipa` for testing or CI
* Helps test the build process and export pipeline

No additional configuration is needed.

---

## üîê Signed Builds (Optional)

To enable **code signing**, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Repository Variable

Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Variables and secrets ‚Üí Variables**

Add:

```
ENABLE_CODE_SIGNING = true
```

### 2. Add Secrets

Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Variables and secrets ‚Üí Secrets**

Add:

| Name                              | Description                               |
