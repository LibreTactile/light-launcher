# Light Launcher

**Mobile Derivative of TOMAT Navigator**
*A tactile mobile launcher for nonlinear, accessible interaction*

**Light Launcher** brings the [TOMAT Navigator](https://github.com/LibreTactile/tomat) experience to Android/iOS. Paired with a 3D-printed tactile grid, it enables **nonlinear, multimodal navigation** through audio and haptic feedback‚Äîmaking apps, files, and settings more accessible to blind and visually impaired users.

Screen readers often force linear navigation. Light Launcher offers a **spatial, touch-based alternative**, enabling users to explore and jump between elements intuitively.
